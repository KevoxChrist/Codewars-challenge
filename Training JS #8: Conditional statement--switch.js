// Task
// Complete the function howManydays. It accepts 1 parameter month, which means the month of the year. Different months have a different number of days as shown in the table below. Return the number of days that are in month. There is no need for input validation: month will always be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 12.

// +---------------+-------------+
// |    month      |    days     |
// +---------------+-------------+
// |1,3,5,7,8,10,12|     31      |
// +---------------+-------------+
// |4,6,9,11       |     30      |
// +---------------+-------------+
// |2              |     28      |  (Do not consider the leap year)
// +---------------+-------------+
// Tip: Using default for most of the cases can reduce your work.

//MY THOUGHTS
//I Found this challenge on the JavaScript training playlist. This challenge was a complete game changer for me because I had no idea that you could stack cases within a switch statement. Of course
// I dug deeper to find out if I could stack cases because writing a case for each month would be very long and repetitive considering that most of them would have the same value. Great Problem!
