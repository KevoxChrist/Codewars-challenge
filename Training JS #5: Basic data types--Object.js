// Task
// Give you a function animal, accept 1 parameter:obj like this:
// {name:"dog",legs:4,color:"white"}

// and return a string like this:
// "This white dog has 4 legs."




function animal(obj){
  
  return `This ${obj.color} ${obj.name} has ${obj.legs} legs.`;
}


//MY THOUGHTS
// I liked this challenge because it strengthened my muscles for accessing a property in an object and it's value. I found this problem within a JavaScript Training playlist which I found to be helpful!
